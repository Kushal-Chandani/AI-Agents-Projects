# AI Agents Projects Hub

Welcome to my personal AI Agents Projects Hub! This repository is my canvas for learning, building, and experimenting with autonomous AI agents every day. It's a living portfolio of my journey into the exciting world of AI.

## üöÄ About This Repository

This space is dedicated to my passion for AI. I'm committed to building and learning every week, and this repository is a reflection of that journey. Here, I explore different aspects of AI agents, from simple automation scripts to complex, intelligent systems.

The main goals are:
- **Daily Learning & Building:** To consistently practice and improve my skills in AI agent development.
- **Project Portfolio:** To showcase a curated collection of my work.
- **Experimentation:** To test new ideas, frameworks, and technologies in the AI space.

## üìÇ Current Projects

Here's a snapshot of what I'm currently working on. Each project is a standalone exploration into a specific application of AI agents.

Each project is self-contained. To get started with a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

Generally, you will need to:
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Kushal-Chandani/AI-Agents-Projects.git`
2.  Navigate to a project directory: `cd <project-name>`
3.  Install the required dependencies (usually in a `requirements.txt` file): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run the application as described in the project's `README.md`.

## üí° Future Work

I am constantly working on new ideas and adding more projects to this repository. This collection will grow as I continue to learn and build. Stay tuned for more exciting AI agents!
